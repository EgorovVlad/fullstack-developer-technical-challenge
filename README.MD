# Project Overview

This project was developed for the Fullstack Developer Technical Challenge, which focuses on building a complete full-stack web application. It uses modern technologies such as Express.js for the backend, Vite for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database. The application provides a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface and demonstrates robust full-stack development techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js)
- **Frontend**: React with Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Docker)
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript types shared between backend and frontend for consistent data modeling

## Quick Guide to Run the Project

1. **Backend**
    - Navigate to the `backend` folder and refer to the README for setup and running instructions.
2. **Frontend**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` folder and refer to the README for setup and running instructions.

Ensure you have Docker installed and running for the database setup.
